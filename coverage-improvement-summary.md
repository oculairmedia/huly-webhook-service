# Test Coverage Improvement Summary

## Overview
Successfully improved test coverage for the health and stats routes in the Huly webhook service.

## Coverage Improvements

### health.js
- **Before**: 50.4% coverage
- **After**: 88% coverage  
- **Improvement**: +37.6% coverage

#### Remaining Uncovered Lines:
- Lines 73, 96-98: Error handling in basic health check
- Lines 176-186: Change stream status details in detailed health check
- Lines 211-215: Webhook service active count
- Lines 243-247: Delivery service stats
- Lines 281-283: Error handling in detailed health check
- Lines 332-333: Error handling in ready check

### stats.js
- **Before**: 91.54% coverage  
- **After**: 91.54% coverage (maintained)
- **Status**: Already excellent coverage

#### Remaining Uncovered Lines:
- Lines 74, 103, 144, 173, 200, 248: Minor error handling paths

## Key Test Additions

### Health Route Tests Added:
1. **Detailed Health Check Tests**:
   - All service healthy scenario
   - Database ping failure
   - Database getInfo error
   - Missing database service
   - Change stream inactive
   - Missing change stream service
   - Change stream getStatus error
   - Missing webhook service
   - Webhook service error
   - Missing delivery service
   - Delivery service error
   - Multiple service failures
   - Unexpected errors

2. **Ready Endpoint Tests**:
   - Database ping error handling
   - Missing database service
   - Missing change stream service
   - Unexpected error handling

3. **Basic Health Check Tests**:
   - Missing webhook service
   - Missing delivery service
   - Delivery service getStats error
   - Complete health check failure

### Stats Route Tests Added:
1. **Error Handling Tests**:
   - Delivery service error in /api/stats
   - Webhook service error in /api/stats/webhooks
   - Delivery service error in /api/stats/deliveries
   - Performance stats errors for both delivery and changeStream
   - Event stats error
   - Error stats failure
   - Health summary errors for all services

## Test Infrastructure Improvements

1. **Enhanced Mock Setup**:
   - Added proper logger mock with timeStart method
   - Added getStatus method to changeStream mock
   - Improved error handler middleware in tests

2. **Configuration Mocking**:
   - Added complete config structure for health checks
   - Included server, logging, dlq, and metrics config

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

1. **Health Route** (to reach 100%):
   - Add tests for service initialization timing issues
   - Test concurrent health check requests
   - Add tests for partial service initialization states

2. **Stats Route** (already excellent):
   - Consider adding integration tests for complex query combinations
   - Add performance benchmarks for large datasets

## Files Modified

1. `/opt/stacks/huly-selfhost/huly-webhook/tests/unit/routes/health.test.js`
   - Added 24 new test cases
   - Enhanced mock setup
   - Improved error handling

2. `/opt/stacks/huly-selfhost/huly-webhook/tests/unit/routes/stats.test.js`
   - Added 8 new error handling test cases
   - Enhanced validation testing

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run health route tests with coverage
npm test -- tests/unit/routes/health.test.js --coverage

# Run stats route tests with coverage  
npm test -- tests/unit/routes/stats.test.js --coverage

# Run both with coverage summary
