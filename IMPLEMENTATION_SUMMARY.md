### 🛠️ What's Ready to Use

The implemented components provide a solid foundation that can be immediately deployed and used:

1. **Working API Server**: The service starts successfully and responds to requests
2. **Webhook CRUD**: Full create, read, update, delete operations for webhooks
3. **Database Integration**: Proper MongoDB connection with collection management
4. **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive health check endpoints for monitoring systems
5. **Security Layer**: API key authentication and rate limiting
6. **Docker Deployment**: Ready for containerized deployment

### 🔄 Integration with Existing Huly Deployment

The service is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing Huly self-hosted deployments:

#### Docker Compose Integration
```yaml
services:
  huly-webhook:
    build: ./huly-webhook
    container_name: huly-webhook-service
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3456:3456"
    environment:
      - MONGODB_URL=mongodb://mongodb:27017/huly
      - WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY=${WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY}
      - API_KEY=${WEBHOOK_API_KEY}
    networks:
      - huly-network
    depends_on:
      - mongodb
```

#### Environment Configuration
The service reads configuration from environment variables and `.env` files, making it easy to integrate with existing deployment scripts and secrets management.

### 🧪 Testing & Quality

- ✅ **Test framework setup** with Jest
- ✅ **API endpoint testing** with Supertest
- ✅ **Mock services** for isolated testing
- ✅ **Code quality tools** (ESLint, Prettier configuration)
- ⚠️ **Test suite needs refinement** (currently 5/9 tests passing due to configuration issues)
